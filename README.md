# Apriori-_Algorithm
## Introduction 
The Apriori algorithm can be considered the foundational algorithm in basket analysis. Basket analysis is the study of a clientâ€™s basket while shopping.
The goal is to find combinations of products that are often bought together, which we call frequent itemsets. The technical term for the domain is Frequent Itemset Mining.
